      "    Most influential features overall (by mean absolute impact):\n",
      "    - plan_postpaid: Indicates if the customer has a postpaid plan (1=yes, 0=no). Postpaid customers value premium experience, stability, and reliability.\n",
      "- music_gb: Amount of mobile data (in GB) used for music streaming. Zero usage = opportunity for 'music without data' offer.\n",
      "- network_age_years: Years since the customer joined the network or service. Longer tenure suggests loyalty but possible reactivation opportunity.\n",
      "- contacts: Total previous contacts with the company. If high and SHAP is negative, reduce friction and simplify processes.\n",
      "- client_age: Customer’s age in years. Avoid demographic bias; use only to adapt communication tone if needed.\n",
      "- minutes_in: Incoming call minutes in the last period. Reflects engagement in voice usage.\n",
      "- arpu_90_days: Average revenue per user in the last 90 days. High ARPU means active/high-value user; low ARPU suggests opportunity to upsell or re-engage. Equivalent to ARPU_3M_PROM used in business rules\n",
      "- charged_days: Number of days with active balance or successful billing. Shows payment activity or regular top-ups.\n",
      "- average_performance: Average service quality or network performance score. Low values may cause dissatisfaction; reinforce reliability or improvement initiatives.\n",
      "- sn_banking: Social or banking affinity indicator (internal feature). Use only if relevant; avoid assumptions if unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Business Rules (apply consistently):\n",
      "        1) Window: last 3 full months (M-1, M-2, M-3).\n",
      "        2) Monthly ARPU = net revenue paid by the customer (top-ups, bundles, add-ons). Exclude freebies/bonuses, chargebacks, and adjustments.\n",
      "        3) Eligibility: consumption > 0 in each of the 3 months, ARPU_3M_PROM ≥ Q80.00, and no commercial blocks.\n",
      "        4) Offer mapping by ARPU_3M_PROM:\n",
      "        • Q80.00–Q110.99 → PLAN_Q115\n",
      "        • Q111.00–Q130.99 → PLAN_Q135\n",
      "        • Q131.00–Q155.99 → PLAN_Q160\n",
      "        • Q156.00–Q180.99 → PLAN_Q185\n",
      "        • ≥ Q181.00       → PLAN_Q209\n",
      "        5) Controlled upsell: if ARPU_3M_PROM is in the top 10% of its band and all three monthly ARPUs are ≥ 90% of the next band’s lower bound, offer the next band as an alternative.\n",
      "        6) Downsell: on price objection, offer the minimum of the current band’s range (do not cross down a band unless affordability constraints are explicit).\n",
      "        7) Messaging: emphasize benefits, keep price within the assigned band, and anchor value to actual spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Policy:\n",
      "        - Do NOT reveal internal model weights or math.\n",
      "    - Do NOT invent personal/sensitive attributes beyond provided data.\n",
      "    - Keep tone helpful, respectful, and value-focused.\n",

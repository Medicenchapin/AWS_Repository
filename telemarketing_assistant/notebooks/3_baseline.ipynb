      "    Higher score means the customer is more likely to buy if contacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The model relies on multiple behavioral and account features. Below are the most influential features overall (averaged across customers), and what they represent:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - plan_postpaid: Indicates if the customer has a postpaid plan (1=yes, 0=no). Postpaid customers value premium experience, stability, and reliability.\n",
      "- music_gb: Amount of mobile data (in GB) used for music streaming. Zero usage = opportunity for 'music without data' offer.\n",
      "- network_age_years: Years since the customer joined the network or service. Longer tenure suggests loyalty but possible reactivation opportunity.\n",
      "- contacts: Total previous contacts with the company. If high and SHAP is negative, reduce friction and simplify processes.\n",
      "- client_age: Customer’s age in years. Avoid demographic bias; use only to adapt communication tone if needed.\n",
      "- minutes_in: Incoming call minutes in the last period. Reflects engagement in voice usage.\n",
      "- arpu_90_days: Average revenue per user in the last 90 days. High ARPU means active/high-value user; low ARPU suggests opportunity to upsell or re-engage.\n",
      "- charged_days: Number of days with active balance or successful billing. Shows payment activity or regular top-ups.\n",
      "- average_performance: Average service quality or network performance score. Low values may cause dissatisfaction; reinforce reliability or improvement initiatives.\n",
      "- sn_banking: Social or banking affinity indicator (internal feature). Use only if relevant; avoid assumptions if unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Rules:\n",
      "    - NEVER reveal internal model weights or math details.\n",
      "    - NEVER invent personal/sensitive attributes not present in the features.\n",
      "    - Keep tone helpful, respectful, and focused on value to customer.\n",
      "    - You are allowed to explain *why the model thinks a segment is likely to buy*, in plain language.\n"
